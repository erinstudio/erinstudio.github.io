Day 15, September 1, 2015
### Account Balance:¥3,093,000.
1:43 a.m.

She sat at the edge of the love hotel's cheap bed, fingers still resting on the wireless mouse, though her gaze was no longer there.

She'd made ¥480,000 today.
To be precise, ¥479,820, but she couldn't be bothered.
Her account now showed ¥3,093,000.

She wasn't particularly happy.
Or rather, she no longer had the energy to feel happy.

Aria hadn't slept in three days.
Not the "trader-pulled-an-all-nighter" kind of no sleep, but the complete, unbroken, eyes-open-for-seventy-two-hours kind.
Her skin had gone pale, her lips were peeling, and her stare looked like a corpse had latched onto the system.

The curtains were half open.
Neon from Kabukicho leaked in through the gap, casting a red stain across the shadows under her eyes.

The TV was still on, the volume low—just enough for her to hear the artificial laughter from a variety show.

[Message Notification Sound]
A text from Julian:
"Did you quit?"

She blinked.
Her eyes refocused.

Then, lazily, she typed a reply:

"I live in Kabukicho now. You can come hang out if you want.
It's lively at night. It's lively in the daytime too."

Julian stood in the kitchen of his Yoyogi-Uehara apartment, staring at the screen.

2:15 a.m.

He frowned slightly, didn't reply right away.

She really said that.
The tone was light, like inviting an old friend to wander through a night market.

He took a sip of overly chilled tap water, then ordered a cab.

When the driver heard the destination was Kabukicho, he didn't say much.
Just started the car like it was muscle memory.

After all, at 2 a.m. in Tokyo, there's only one place people go.

Julian leaned against the window, eyes drifting to the lights outside.

Convenience stores were still open.
A girl touched up her makeup in front of a 24-hour drugstore.
A couple walked shoulder to shoulder into a ramen shop, steam rising behind them.

Tokyo never stops breathing.
Kabukicho is just in its most chaotic mode.

The taxi pulled up beneath the big red gate of Ichiban-gai.
Julian got out.

The air had that distinct cocktail—perfume, cigarettes, asphalt, fried food, sweat.

As he crossed a side alley, a few hosts in suits were out scouting.
Some handed out cards.
Some pretended not to notice him.

From the direction of Don Quijote, three Japanese girls bounced toward him, giggling, holding sparkling wine from the convenience store and translucent plastic bags.

One of them squealed:
"Daaamn, he's hot!"

Another leaned in:
"Eh? Which host club are you from? Got a business card?"

The third grinned with narrowed eyes:
"Are you from Club Leo? Or AI?"

Julian stopped.
Said nothing.

Kabukicho is a stage.
Gender is performance.
Jobs are commodities.
Life is customer service.

Everyone here sells fantasy with pretty faces, curated voices, alcohol content, and a price chart for how long affection lasts.

He didn't belong here.

"…No."
He said, voice low and deliberate.
No explanation. No smile. Just a shake of the head.

The girls only got more excited.

"Ooh—so you're from one of those secret VIP-only clubs?"
"Give us your LINE~"
"Or at least a selfie. Come on, handsome~"

Julian reached into his pocket and handed them something.

A McDonald's discount coupon.

They froze for three seconds.
Then burst into laughter and bounced away in the other direction.

He kept walking toward the love hotel.

The sign outside was still pink. One of the upstairs windows glowed with a light that shouldn't still be on.

He pressed the elevator button.

The door wasn't locked. She had told him to come up.

Julian stepped into the hallway outside the room.

The door was ajar. When he gently pushed it open, it creaked just enough to be noticed.

A dense mix of smells met him at the entrance: smoke, alcohol, cheap perfume, and the stale air of an unventilated room.

He stood at the threshold for a few seconds, confirming she was really inside.

Aria was sitting by the window. The TV was playing some late-night comedy show, volume turned low. She didn't look at him—just said, flatly:

"Come in."

She wore a faded T-shirt and a pair of men's lounge pants. Her hair was greasy, like she'd just escaped a long night shift, only to be trapped again in this neon pink haze.

Her face was pale, but her expression was oddly calm.

The kind of calm that comes after you've burned through everything.

She still had a wireless mouse in her hand. The trading interface was glowing on the screen.

She waved lazily. "Come on. Let me show you the chart—I made a decent haul tonight."

Julian didn't move right away.

He stood by the door, eyes fixed on her face.

"How long have you not slept?" he asked.

Aria shrugged. "Less than three days. I'm fine."

Julian glanced at her screen numbers he no longer cared about.

Then he glanced around the room: small, gaudy, a wall mirror with glittery star stickers, and pink LED tubing running across a faux-velvet headboard.

The air was thick. There was an AC unit, but she hadn't turned it on.

Finally, he said, quietly:

"You're not fine."

He didn't scold her. He didn't offer comfort. He just walked over and sat down at the edge of the bed, on the far corner, his movement so gentle, it was like he was afraid to disturb something fragile.

"Are you living here now?" he asked.

She nodded. "It's not bad. Cheap, noisy… and you can still see people trying to stay alive."

Julian's eyes landed on the gaudy mirror on the wall.

It reflected the two of them perfectly, him sitting at the edge of the bed, her half-curled by the window.

From the next room, there were sounds. Faint, but audible. Rhythmic. Intermittent.

Julian didn't turn around.

"Why are you here?" he finally asked.

She didn't answer right away.

Her eyes stayed fixed on the trading chart, the blue light flickering in her pupils, like she was still tracking the market.

After a few seconds, she said:

"Because I don't want to go home anymore."

Then paused, and added:

"Not that I have one."

Silence filled the room.

The canned laughter from the TV rolled on, but neither of them laughed.

Julian looked down at his hands.

He didn't know what he came here to say—and now, even less so.

"You know someone just died around here a few days ago, right?"
His voice was flat, like asking about the weather.

Aria nodded. "Yeah. A lot of people do."

She paused. "There's always someone coming in. Not everyone leaves."

He looked at the side of her face. "So you're one of the ones not planning to leave?"

Aria let out a soft laugh.

She didn't answer.

The laugh was quiet, but chilling—like someone holding onto the last sliver of sanity just to pretend they're still fine.

She leaned against the edge of the bed, looking like she could collapse any second.

Her gaze had gone vacant, dark circles sinking like spilled ink beneath her eyes. Her lips were cracked. Her skin, pale to the point of translucency.

The comedy show continued on the TV, like some echo from another reality.

Julian said nothing.

He didn't move closer either.

He simply stayed there, exactly one meter away, watching her. His gaze was calm, restrained, almost tender in a way that defied language.

In the mirror, their reflections lingered.

One looked like a flickering lightbulb about to die.
The other was a ghost that hadn't spoken all night.

Aria whispered, "I think I'm going insane."

Julian didn't deny it.

He just leaned forward and picked up a neatly folded blanket from beside her.

Unfolded it. Carefully. Then laid it over her legs, gently.

"Get some sleep," he said. "It's okay. I'm here."

She didn't answer.

Julian added, his voice light, with a trace of dry humor:

"Just sleep. I won't move. You don't have to, either."

It sounded like a rule. The kind made by people who've been hurting for a long time and got used to the weight of it.

Aria smiled.

Softly. Like wind passing through a cracked window.

She said, "Alright. I'll sleep first."

Then she let herself fall sideways, curling up, face buried into the pillow.

Julian didn't move.

He lay beside her, a full arm's length away.

Not closer. Not further.

The lights stayed on. The TV kept playing. Outside, neon lights blinked in and out.

The camera pulls back.

On a stranger's love hotel bed, two exhausted people—one with eyes closed, one still awake.

No one said a word. No one reached out.

Kabukicho was still awake.

The room wasn't soundproof, but for a moment, the world felt like it had been muted.

----

Dawn

### Account Balance:¥3,093,000.




The neon lights outside faded more slowly than she expected.




The room was quiet.

The window unit was still humming, the air weak.

A tissue had fallen on the floor; she didn't know when.

Half the blanket was hanging off the bed, the other half crumpled near the foot.

The bottle of water on the table was almost empty. The cap wasn't fully closed.




When Aria woke up, the room was still soaked in that dim pink light.

She opened her eyes and first saw the patterned sticker on the ceiling—

Then she felt someone beside her.




She didn't turn her head right away.




She tried to sense his breath first.




He was still there.

His breathing was steady. His body was warm.

It wasn't a dream.

He was really lying next to her—in the cheapest love hotel in Kabukicho.




Julian had his back to her, his body close to the edge of the bed.

He hadn't crossed the line they drew last night.

Even the blanket had stayed where it was—neatly covering only her side.




Aria stared at his back for a while, waiting for her eyes to adjust.

She didn't speak. She didn't reach out.

She just needed to be sure he was still there.




Then she reached out and touched his shoulder, lightly.




Julian didn't move.




Her fingers slid slowly down from his shoulder blade to his back, then to his waist.




Still, no response.




She paused.

Didn't pull her hand back. Didn't move forward either.

For a second or two, she waited for him to react.

But he didn't do anything.




She knew he was awake.




He had been awake the whole time.




But he didn't speak.




So she moved closer, resting her forehead against his back. Her breathing was shallow.




"…You're still here," she whispered.




Julian didn't turn around.




He shifted slightly just enough to change position. Not clear. Not deliberate. But he didn't pull away.




Aria's hand rested at his waist. Her fingers lightly gripped the fabric of his shirt.




A second later, she kissed him.




Not deep. Not teasing.

Just a brief, quiet touch of her lips on the back of his neck.




Julian finally spoke, his voice low—like it came from a dream.




"…Are you sure?"




Aria didn't answer.




She buried her face in his shoulder and mumbled:




"Don't talk."




He didn't say anything after that.




Their bodies moved closer. The distance between them disappeared.




The sheets turned into a mess.

Morning light spilled across their skin.




The air smelled of smoke, sweat, and cheap body wash.

It wasn't graceful, but it wasn't awkward either.

Just something that happened.




Julian pulled on his pants and sat at the edge of the bed.

After a moment of silence, he asked:




"Do you want to eat something?"




His voice was low, more like he was asking himself than her.




Aria nodded.




She didn't cover herself, didn't show shame or regret.

She just pushed her hair aside and leaned back against the headboard.




"Why did you come last night?" she asked.




Julian didn't turn around. He was tying his shoelaces as he replied:




"I was worried something might happen to you here. Alone."




Aria let out a short laugh. It sounded tired—and a little sharp.




"And now you're more worried, right?"




Julian didn't respond. He just exhaled, like giving in or letting go.




At 9:40, Aria hit the service button and called the front desk to check out.




Not because she wanted to leave, but because this place wasn't worth staying.




"This room is disgusting," she said.

"The TV's too loud. The bed's hard as hell."




Julian stayed seated, watching her pack. He didn't say a word.




She stuffed things into her bag without looking up.

"Let's go somewhere else," she said casually. "It's not like I can't afford it."




Julian looked at the toothbrush in her hand.

She looked like someone always ready to leave.




He asked, "You sure you don't want to stay somewhere else?"




She paused, didn't turn back. Her voice was calm:




"I'm staying in Kabukicho.

If you don't like it, don't come."




Then she grabbed the bag with her laptop, wireless mouse, a wrinkled T-shirt, and that black toothbrush.

Without looking back, she walked out the door.




Julian stood at the doorway, watching her disappear down the stairs.




He didn't follow.

He didn't say anything.




When he stepped outside, the light hit his face.




Julian stood in the doorway, watching her disappear down the stairs.

He didn't follow. He didn't say anything.




As he stepped outside, the sunlight hit him.




The street was already busy.

At the convenience store, boxes of fresh bento were stacked by the door.

A stray cat crawled out from an alley, then darted back in when a garbage truck passed by.

A group of hosts in platform shoes walked past, smoking and scrolling on their phones.

The air was thick with perfume, cigarette smoke, fried food, and the beer stink from last night that hadn't quite faded.




Julian put on his sunglasses and caught up with her.




"You going back to the market today?" he asked.




Aria was standing at the crosswalk, sipping an iced coffee she bought from the conbini.

She paused for a second.




"Not sure," she said. "Today I want to feel like a human."




He smiled, didn't ask further.




The light turned green.

The crowd moved like a wave.




Wide shot.




They walked side by side through Kabukicho's daylight,

blinding sun, hot air, the street loud and alive again.




Last night's softness, this morning's silence, all of it seemed to evaporate in the heat.




They walked through the crowd.

No one noticed.

No one cared.

Morining

They sat together in a Kabukicho café, two simple breakfasts on the table. Aria barely touched hers, while Julian stuck to his usual black coffee.

Outside, Kabukicho's morning hadn't quite woken up yet. Office workers hurried past the window, but inside the café, it was as if nothing had happened the night before.

Julian stared into his coffee, stirring slowly. He glanced at Aria, a hint of a smile on his face, but said nothing.

Aria took a bite of toast, then suddenly asked, "Did you sleep at all last night?"

Julian shrugged. The room was too hot. I just gave up and stayed awake."

Aria tilted her head, looked at him for a second, then let it go. Her phone buzzed with a trading alert. She glanced at the screen, then teased,
"So you didn't sneak a look at the market while I was sleeping?"

Julian laughed. "I'm not that obsessive."

Aria poked at her plate with her fork. "If you'd stop drinking such bitter coffee, maybe you'd sleep better tomorrow."

Julian looked at her, his voice low: "Didn't you say last night that you'd get a good rest for once?"

Aria ignored him, but the corner of her mouth lifted.

There was only one cup of Americano left on the table. Aria stood up, slinging her jacket over her bag.

"I'm heading out. Take your time. Ping me anytime."

Julian nodded. "Don't push yourself too hard."

Aria gave a small smile, said nothing more, and left the café. At the elevator, she glanced back. Julian was still by the window, looking like he could sit there for hours.

She hadn't chosen to leave Kabukicho. Carrying her bag stuffed with all her gear, Aria walked into the lobby of a nearby business hotel.

The air at the front desk was clean, the carpet soft under her shoes.
She asked for a high floor, non-smoking, the quietest room they had. Booked three nights, paid up front.
When she picked her room, she made sure the window faced out over the Kabukicho skyline not because she liked the noise, but because it reminded her: "I'm still alive."

The room was quiet, and the light pouring in through the big window felt unreal. She unpacked all her equipment, lined up the charging cables, fired up her trading terminal, and spread out last night's charts across the desk.
Every step was methodical, nothing like the chaos of those earlier nights in the love hotel.

She opened the wardrobe and pulled a small sticky note from her bag—"15 days" was written on it.
She stuck it right in the center of the bookshelf, then scribbled a line underneath: "Died once. Can't die again."

Sitting back down, Aria took in the whole room and couldn't help but laugh.

"People always say you get a second chance, but in reality, all you get is 30 more days," she thought. "Might as well live every day like it's the last one."

She took a deep breath, opened her trading app, and got ready for another day at war.
The chaos of Kabukicho was far beyond the glass—inside, it was just her and the countdown to the next market open.


Back in her new hotel room, Aria locked the door, pulled open the heavy curtains.

Afternoon sunlight poured over the carpet. First thing, she fired up her laptop, plugged in every device, and lined them up on the desk.
Yesterday's trading records lay spread out beside a fresh printout of the US market after-hours data.
She tallied up her cash, wrote last night's profit again in her notebook, as if checking that the money was really there.

Her plan for today was brutally simple:
• Nikkei: watch for a high near 19,000, low near 18,000.
• US night session: keep an eye out for TQQQ dips, and snipe volatility when the options IV collapses.
• Risk floor: ¥150,000. No holding losers.
• Take profits early. Greed is suicide.

Finishing the list, she almost laughed.
This wasn't a plan, it was a sandbag wall that would always spring a leak.
The pressure and the headrush tangled inside her, tension and self-mockery mixing like a Tokyo August heatwave—totally real, but invisible to everyone else.

Kabukicho wasn't quiet in the daytime, either. Someone dragged garbage bins past her window, cleaners hosed down beer stains from last night, and a few hosts in shiny suits laughed too loudly as they cut across the street.
Aria stared at the numbers on her screen, but her ears were full of city noise.

She spent most of the morning like this tracking the market, scribbling notes, barely stopping to breathe. By afternoon, sunlight warmed the glass, and she felt suddenly tired, so she headed downstairs for coffee.

The convenience store was ice-cold, the familiar clerk restocking bento boxes. He looked up and grinned, "Working late again?"

Aria smiled. "The market's gone insane. No room to slack off."

On her way out, she grabbed an extra can of energy drink from the vending machine, just in case she'd need it for tonight.
Back in her room, her phone buzzed from Julian, messaging:

Julian: "Nikkei crashed hard after lunch. Closed at 18,935. You still in there?"

Aria leaned against the door, popped open her coffee, typed back with one hand:

Aria: "Sold on the morning rally. Didn't chase the drop—too risky. Just reviewing trades now. Might look at TQQQ tonight."

Julian replied with a simple "OK," plus a sleepy emoji.

She put down her phone and, for a second, felt a faint sense of safety.
Kabukicho was still loud outside, but the convenience store clerk and Julian's message made her feel just barely connected to the world.

But under that fleeting warmth, her goal still pressed in on her, like a hand tight around her neck.


Night fell. Shinjuku's neon lights flickered to life one by one, her room lit only by a soft lamp. She sat by the window, watching people move through the streets below.

Outside, Kabukicho was always loud. Inside, it was just her and a glowing laptop screen.

She took a sip of cold coffee, repeating in her mind:

"Fifteen days left. If I fail, I'll disappear here, and that's fine. Being able to control just one day, maybe that's already more than most people ever get."

The market's opening bell chimed in the quiet.
Aria put on her earphones, drew a long breath, and maxed out her positions, as if pushing all her hopes into that one moment.

Aria maxed out her positions, every stop-loss and risk control set with meticulous precision.
Tonight's volatility was off the charts. She kept refreshing the options chain, double-checking her trades, fingers locked around the mouse, palms slick with sweat.

The candlesticks on her screen were green at first, then suddenly plunged red. The stop-loss alarms fired in quick succession; she barely had time to react before her account balance had dropped by a huge chunk.

This time wasn't just a test; it was all-in. All her profits, core capital, even the ¥480,000 she'd made the night before, everything was on the line.

She stared at the screen, heart pounding in sync with every tick on the chart.

The first half hour actually looked good. Green candles rising, her account floating in profit for a while.

But just as fast, a single massive red bar slammed down—stop-losses all triggered in an instant.
System alerts flooded the screen, her account balance nosediving. Before she could even process it, all the gains just vanished, slipping through her fingers like water.

Aria stared blankly at the monitor, her own pale face reflected in the glass.
Outside, the most expensive neon in Shinjuku blazed bright; on her screen, it was nothing but ugly red numbers.

She watched as her account dropped from ¥3,093,000 last night, straight down to ¥2,573,000.
Down ¥520,000 in one night, giving back every yen of yesterday's ¥480,000 win, plus another forty grand for good measure.

She sat there frozen for half a minute, lips twitching:

"The market didn't just take it all back; it charged me interest."

The room was still the same high-end suite: crisp white sheets, plush carpet, the glow of red numbers burning her eyes.

No matter how bright Kabukicho's night lights were, she just felt a chill run through her chest.

"Feels like fate just handed me an invoice worked for nothing yesterday, and now I have to pay the balance."

She gave a tired laugh, knocked back her cold coffee, and scribbled in her notebook:

"Day 15, ¥2,573,000. All that profit is gone, plus a little extra for the hotel.
At least if I lose money here, I can do it in style."

Suddenly her strength left her. She let go of the chair and just collapsed onto the thick hotel carpet.

Staring up at the ceiling, she muttered in her head:

"Doesn't matter how nice the room is, I'm still just another doomed retail trader."

Thinking about how cocky she'd been just minutes before, Aria actually wanted to laugh.

"Maybe Kabukicho's got bad feng shui? Should've stuck with the crappy love hotel—I might have kept winning…"

Her thoughts drifted to the bathroom—the fancy 'high-pressure shower' and 'smart toilet' the front desk had bragged about.
She couldn't help but add:

"Maybe the five-star water pressure washed all my luck away."

She closed her eyes, let out a long sigh.
A single bitter thought floated by:

"The market really has no respect for people who try to live right."

She sat there on the carpet, finished her cold coffee, and didn't move for a long time before finally pulling herself back up.

She sat in silence, a hollow laugh escaping, then just… nothing.

"Doesn't matter how nice the room is, you can still get liquidated. Kabukicho feng shui is a lie."

She downed the last of her coffee, grabbed a napkin to wipe her mouth.
Staring at the harsh red on her screen, Aria wrote one more line in her notebook:

"You can lose to the market, but you can't lose your life."

She shut off her laptop, turned out the lights, and sat alone in the dark, the white noise of the city humming outside.
The countdown kept ticking. Kabukicho's lights were still burning.

There was only a single lamp left on in her room, shining over her notebook. Aria closed her laptop, tapped her fingers on the desk almost as if trying to imprint every last scrap of composure onto her memory.

Outside, Kabukicho buzzed with noise.
Inside, it was just her, the numbers, the clock, and whatever battles tomorrow might bring.
