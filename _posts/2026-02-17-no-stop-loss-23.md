Julian hadn't spoken in days.

He only ordered one coffee.

He no longer used the downstairs café, where he once complained about the foam.

Even the glass doors, he pushed more gently now.

He no longer looked at anyone, nor did he care who was watching him.

The system remained still.

So did he.

But long before that, something had already begun.

That evening, only a few people were left wrapping up in the conference room.

Jess came in through the side door.

She said nothing.

She picked up a blank form from the printer station.

Rick was there too.

He stood by the window.

His phone screen was on, but he wasn't typing.

He said quietly,
"I need you to deal with someone."

Jess didn't respond.

She turned a page, her voice low like she was just talking to herself.

"If something needs to be looked at, I'll look at it."

Rick said nothing more.

He stood there for another two seconds, then walked away without taking his water bottle.

Jess didn't look back.

A few days later, Jess received an email from Rick.

The subject line read:
"Internal concern / non-collaborative behaviour"

There was no attachment.

No context.

Just a few vague lines that read more like a whisper than a report.

She didn't reply.

She didn't archive it either.

She just closed the window.

That afternoon, she went up to the records room on the second floor.

She didn't take any documents.

She simply walked the hallway slowly, making a loop.

The system moved three days later.

After receiving Rick's note about Julian's allegedly inappropriate comment regarding Japanese people, Jess opened the backend panel from her desk.

She didn't rush.

She scrolled through the employee list, slowly, until she stopped at Julian's name.

Her gaze didn't move.

She opened his profile and pulled up the identity record.

The first line read:
"Ethnicity: White - British"

She didn't look away immediately.

The phrase wasn't unusual in the system.

She had seen it hundreds of times.

But this time, she read it three times in a row.

She kept scrolling.

The passport copy was British.

Birthplace: London.

Education: LSE.

All in English.

No overseas exchange.

No additional notes.

No alternate nationality.

She flipped to "History."

The page loaded slowly.

Only one sentence appeared:
"No previous modifications."

She frowned.

This wasn't what she expected.

Something, she felt, should be there.

She returned to the first page and stared at one field.

"Surname: Watanabe"

Her hand paused.

She realized she had been slow.

She didn't like that feeling.

She didn't want to admit it either.

From the next desk, she could hear someone binding papers.

The keyboard clicks stopped, then started again, like someone waiting for her to speak.

Jess said nothing.

She just scrolled down one more line.

Then she clicked open the tagging panel and added an audit process.

She didn't hit submit.

The system would handle it automatically.

The email would be generated.

The form would attach itself.

Julian didn't receive that email.

Rick did.

He didn't forward it.

He didn't say anything more.

Jess left work late that night.

She walked slowly.

She didn't look back.

She knew she hadn't crossed a line.

She had only pressed one button.

Only flagged a profile.

But she knew that name.

She didn't say it out loud.

She didn't write it anywhere.

She suddenly remembered, Julian had never come to HR.

Even his year-end forms were submitted on the last day.

No comments.

No notes.

No suggestions.

Jess didn't dig further.

She closed the system tab and switched back to her calendar view.

Her fingers felt slightly stiff.

On the other side of the office floor, no one mentioned it. But everyone knew.

Julian never spoke Japanese at work, only English, in a crisp London accent.

When he spoke in meetings, he talked fast. His emails were precise, even his filler words carried an old-school British corporate tone.

There were no traces of Asia in his cultural habits.

He never brought bento for lunch.

He didn't even understand anime.

But his surname was right there.

Emma once joked with him using "you lot," and he shot back,
"We Asians gotta stick together."

Tomasz almost spat out his coffee.

Emma didn't respond.

She just said,
"You sure about that?"

The mood in the office began to shift.

No one said it aloud, but everyone felt it.

In the pantry, the coffee machine was still dripping. The filter hadn't been changed.

Two people stood talking in the corner, their voices barely above a whisper.

"Rick really built his way up through HR? This time he's blown it."

"Trying to knock out a Tier 3 by snitching? Who's gonna want him on a project after this?"

They didn't comment further.

They fell silent, picked up their mugs, and left.

In the copy room, a printed report cover had been left behind.

No one claimed it.

No one threw it away.

In a small meeting room, Emma and Tomasz sat with three quarterly reports spread out on the table, all old versions pulled from the shared drive.

The meeting notes contained only a few key numbers.

Tomasz tapped his laptop a few times without speaking.

Emma adjusted the chart layout, then undid it twice.

After a while, Tomasz said,
"You know he's insane, right?

But the reports he filed last quarter… I still use that model."

Emma didn't respond right away.

She moved her hand away from the trackpad, closed her eyes for a second, tired, maybe.

"Mad as hell. But sharp."

The words landed quietly.

It wasn't approval.

It wasn't criticism.

It was just true.

The meeting room lights were old, a bit yellow.

The fan turned slowly.

The charts on-screen refreshed on their own.

The print area was unusually quiet.

When Ravi walked in, Julian was already standing at the printer, hands in his pockets, completely still as if waiting for a meaningless beep.

He wasn't looking at anyone.

Just watching a single sheet emerge from the machine.

Ravi approached, holding out a page.

"Someone left this with your name on it."

His voice was soft, a little hesitant,
but steadier than it had been earlier in the week.

Julian took the page, glanced at it.

It was a draft of an old compliance project.

The margins were filled with dense handwritten notes.

It wasn't his handwriting,
but he immediately recognized Emma's style.

The printer light was harsh.

It reflected off the cover plate.

Julian remained still, as if waiting.

Or just standing there.

He watched the final page slide out.

He didn't reach for it.

Ravi had paused when he entered, not dodging past like he used to.

He looked at Julian for a few seconds, then stepped closer and offered the page.

"Someone left this with your name on it."

Julian looked once.

He didn't say thank you.

Didn't act surprised.

He took the paper.

Lowered his gaze.

The red ink notes were familiar.

He could tell exactly which line was Emma's rhythm.

He folded the sheet carefully, quietly.

No wasted motion.

No sound.

He didn't look up, just pressed a fingertip lightly to the paper's corner.

Ravi didn't leave.

He stood there a moment longer, watching.

It wasn't fear.

And it wasn't caution.

It was recognition.

Like someone finally understanding the blueprint they'd failed to read before.

He said nothing more.

Then turned and walked away.

Julian didn't move.

He could hear the printer continuing behind him and footsteps passing, but he stayed still.

His eyes remained on his own hands as if waiting for some invisible signal to land.

Back at his desk, he tucked the page beneath his work notes.

Didn't read it again.

He made a second cup of coffee.

The water boiled slowly.

The air smelled faintly of stale grounds.

Same mug as that morning.

Slightly chipped.

Light scratches around the rim.

He watched it fill.

Didn't move.

Near noon, Tomasz passed by from the other side.

He held a stack of folders.

He didn't stop.

He just dropped the papers next to Julian's keyboard, barely making a sound.

"Internal audit file. You might want to look at page 4."

He kept walking.

Didn't change pace.

Julian didn't move.

His eyes stayed on his screen.

Nothing open just the glow.

He didn't turn.

Didn't touch the folders.

Didn't tidy his desk.

It was as if he were testing whether he still existed inside this company.

Time passed.

Still, he didn't move.

Eventually, he glanced at the file on his desk.

He didn't turn the page.

He sat at the desk no one else dared use.

Motionless.

That day, he only said one sentence—
At the clock-in machine, he confirmed his temporary badge with the building staff.

Everyone knew.

Now, the ones getting closer to him weren't the reckless.

They were the smart ones.
