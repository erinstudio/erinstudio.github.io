Day 14, August 31, 2015

### Account Balance:¥2,613,000

9:20 a.m. Shibuya, Office 12F




Yuji glanced up at the pale light outside the glass.

Late August in Tokyo was, as always, too bright for its own good.




His coffee was still warm, but he had already refreshed his inbox for the sixth time.




The bid results were due tomorrow.

Today was supposed to be just another Monday.

He told himself not to overthink it.




But when the head of Marketing brought up "Metamind" again in the morning meeting, he felt his chest tighten for half a second.




"The concept is rock solid. Structure's clean, visuals align perfectly with UX."

"I really think the client's going to bite this time."




Yuji nodded, maintaining his usual soft smile.




In truth, the first version of Metamind was written by Aria.




A rough outline, incomplete, buried in an old PowerPoint deck.

She'd tossed it to him casually back then, "Take a look, see if there's anything there" like it wasn't much.




She had just quit her job at the time, uncertain about going freelance, drifting in and out of burnout.

There was always a fragile tension in her eyes, like she was one bad night away from giving up.




Yuji didn't ask too many questions.

He quietly kept the keywords, polished the structure, rebuilt the visuals, and turned it into a full-fledged team proposal.




He didn't put his name on it.

The whole team signed off.

That, in his view, was polite enough.




"She's not the type who can lead client-facing projects anyway."




He absentmindedly opened their chat window, then closed it again.




At the top of the message list was the same unread bubble:




"Hey, did you eat? Let's talk later tonight."




It had been three days.

She still hadn't replied.




He didn't count it as a fight.

She'd done this before, zoning out, getting stuck in her head, disappearing for days at a time.




Then she'd come back like nothing happened, curl up on the sofa, and ask if he wanted instant noodles.




That was just who she was. Sensitive, but harmless.

Yuji had never once thought of her as someone who holds grudges.




6:40 p.m. – Home




The moment he opened the door, he knew she wasn't there.




The apartment was too quiet, not like someone had just left, but like no one had lived there for a while.




No blanket on the couch.

No dishes in the sink.

No laundry drying on the balcony.




Her toothbrush was gone.

So were her slippers by the door.




Yuji dropped his bag onto the couch and noticed her old pink iPhone lying on the edge — cracked case, glue peeling off the corner.




She'd been oddly attached to that thing.

Said there were a few trade notes in the memos she couldn't bear to lose.




He picked it up and pressed the power button.

Nothing.




Held it longer.




The Apple logo flickered once, then disappeared.

The screen blinked white.




Hello

Swipe to begin




Factory reset.




He froze for a moment.

Then turned around and saw the sticky note taped to the fridge.




That same pale green pad she always used.

Neat handwriting in black ink:




"You once said I was too emotional to survive this field.

So I learned to calculate. — A."




Yuji stood in the kitchen, unmoving for half a minute.




Then he let out a short laugh and peeled the note off, tucking it into his wallet.




She's being dramatic again, he thought.




Maybe he'd been too busy lately.

Maybe she felt unheard.

She always needed emotional feedback, and when she didn't get it, she disappeared for a while.




That was her pattern.




Everyone said she was brilliant, but too intense, too much trouble.

He was the only one who'd stayed.




He thought that counted for something.

He thought he was being kind.




He opened the fridge.

It was empty like a reminder.




Still, he kept the note.




As if keeping it would somehow make her return the next morning, smile faintly, and say:




"You really thought I meant it?"




Kabukicho · Room 402 · August 31st, 3:00 p.m.




The room was lit in pink.

Not a romantic pink—something inhuman.

Like a dream soaked in industrial paint. A color never meant for the awake.




Aria took off her jacket, opened the mini fridge, and grabbed a can of low-sugar oolong tea.

She tossed it to the floor.

It rolled twice—like a gong signaling the start of the night.




She sat on the edge of the round bathtub.

Steam gathered over the rose-tiled walls, beading into a thin layer of sweat.




Phone, power bank, portable VPN router, mini keyboard, double-sealed waterproof touch covers

She laid them out like a battlefield engineer.

No ranks, no flags.

Just one woman constructing a war trench that belonged to no country.




And then she stopped.




At that moment, she realized she no longer had an identity.




She was no one's girlfriend.

Not employed by any firm.

Not on a lease.

Not on a company roster.

No chats to reply to.

No clocks to punch in.




"Right now," she whispered,

"I'm a completely anonymous human being."




She let out a short dry laugh, decisive.




Then she peeled off the IC card taped behind her phone case, and dropped it into the bathtub with a plop,

like completing a ritual.




She looked into the mirror. Her voice steady, as if reading a quarterly earnings report:




"I'm no longer the 'aesthetic copywriter.'

Not the 'calm girlfriend.'

Not the 'Chinese expat in UX.'

Not the token Asian in the creative team.

I'm not anyone's version of anything."




"I'm not a label.

I'm a variable."




"I'm the kind of person you can't name,

So you start fearing me."




She stood up and turned off the ceiling light.

The room fell into darkness, save for the projector silently playing a frame from Margin Call.




Her reflection faded from the mirror like a ghost.

All that remained were the flickering digits on the screen.




She blended into the night,

a passenger among drunk salarymen, exhausted hostesses, and 3 a.m. clinic patients.




She once bought stomach meds from a 24-hour pharmacy.

The nurse didn't look her in the eye. Just asked:




"Cash or IC card?"




This was the Kingdom of Night.

And she was using it to end Yuji's daylight.




The bomb was already planted.




No Wi-Fi login. No Bluetooth trace.




She used a disposable Android phone to access the hotel network.

Then fired up the VPN and quietly scheduled a blog post on a burner account.




There would be no fingerprints.




In exactly 18 hours, the trigger would go off.

All automated.

No need to press send.




The post had only one theme:

"The Making of Metamind: A Plagiarism Timeline."




Timestamps.

Wireframes.

Side-by-side copy drafts.

Photos of Yuji's notebook (she had taken them).

Chat exports (already backed up).




Everything clean.

Everything admissible.

Every page is sharp enough to be a pitch deck.




She had told no one.




Not even Julian knew where she was.

He probably thought she was still figuring out a path to financial freedom.




She wasn't looking for sympathy.

She didn't want an "I understand you."




She wanted only one thing:




"Every time he steps into a pitch room,

he has to carry this history with him."




She opened her final reminder.




Trigger time: 08:59 a.m.




Just in time for Yuji's workday to begin.




She took a bite of tempura. Too salty.

Then drained the can of oolong tea.




Steam fogged up the mirror again.

Her outline came back blurry, but intact.




No fear.

No regret.




She pressed the sleep timer.

The projector clicked off.




Silence swallowed the bathroom.




Room 402, in the deepest neon veins of Kabukicho,

stood like a stage where the ending had already been written.




She closed her eyes.




Yuji's script no longer belonged to him.

## Flashback: Three Months Ago




She remembered that night, three months ago.




He was slouched on the couch, flipping through some ad forum while half-watching TV.




"Didn't you write something called meta…something? That proposal?"

"Mind if I use it for reference?"




She didn't say anything. Just nodded.




He chuckled and kept scrolling.




"This idea's kind of interesting… but your ending's way too aggressive. I'll tweak it a bit."




At the time, she didn't realize—

he wasn't just tweaking the ending.




He rewrote the name, the context, and the authorship.

He erased her—entirely.




When she opened the final PDF later, she saw the tagline she'd written had been replaced.

Rewritten into something more "neutral."




And then she got it.




He wasn't dismissing her copy.

He was afraid her sharpness might bleed through and cut the client.




He liked her softer.

More agreeable.

More… normal.




"Like one of my coworkers said, you'd be better off doing lifestyle content.

Strategy's too much for someone like you."




That moment felt like a verdict.




He never knew her memory was disturbingly sharp.




Every time he muttered, "That's not important,"

every deleted file she quietly copied from his laptop,

the day he built a pitch deck off her draft, 

She remembered all of it.




She wasn't trying to win.

She just didn't want him to stay the same.




That lukewarm, reasonable, well-adjusted man—

as harmless as warm water, and just as capable of drowning her.




The man who stole fire and still had the nerve to say:




"You're overreacting."




Her leaving wasn't disappearing.




It was a calculation.




She knew exactly what she was doing.

She knew society would call it "crazy."

But she no longer needed society's language to define her.




She wasn't Aria Lin, a 35-year-old female ex-UX strategist at a Tokyo agency anymore.




She was a free variable.

An unlabelled anomaly.

A packet of Error 404: Not Found in your system.




She sat at the edge of a love hotel's projection bathtub,

typing out one final command:




Detonation Time: September 1st, 08:45 a.m.

Anonymous Email: scheduled

Twitter Auto-post: scheduled

Hook Text: "Who really made Metamind? Let's talk truth."




September 1st, 2:30 p.m. Breakroom




Yuji had just finished making a cup of instant latte when his phone started buzzing nonstop.




Slack notifications piling up.

He opened Twitter.

A headline smacked him in the face:

#Metamind #PlagiarismGate #CreditControversy




His company was tagged.

He was tagged.




His LinkedIn profile had already been screencapped into a four-tile meme under the viral thread.




A blog link was being spammed across every channel.




It was a blog post, elegantly brutal.




Title: "The Metamind Draft Was Never Yours"




It opened with a timeline,

complete with IP addresses, edit history, and time stamps.




Then:

Visual comparisons.

Original sketches.

Pitch framework diagrams.

Three forwarded emails.




30 images + a registry record.

No cursing.

No theatrics.

Just clean, devastating precision.




"April 3, 2015, the name first appeared in my chat with Yuji."

"May 27, I sent an unread draft PDF."

"August 15, I discovered his agency intended to pitch a version with 80% overlap."




She even included the similarity index diagram.




Yuji's pupils dilated.

The coffee in his mouth almost choked him.




First thought: Who did this?

Second: Someone's sabotaging me.

Third: …Aria?




He didn't dare confirm it.




The comments were already on fire:




"So this is how the ad world eats now? Your girlfriend makes the deck, and you just copy-paste?"

"This isn't theft, it's postmodern parasitism. Nice try, bro."

"Yuji, stop pretending, your face is all over this."




HR Meeting, 5:00 p.m.




He was called into a meeting room by HR.




The rep wore rimless glasses. Spoke like a weather report.




"The client has emailed, requesting clarification on the 'creative origin.'"

"Online discussions are impacting brand risk. We recommend you avoid public statements for now."




The air felt suffocatingly still.




As he stepped into the hallway, two younger colleagues walked past, then slowed, whispering:




"…It's him?"




A laugh.

Like a needle.




Yuji's face went pale.

He didn't speak.




For the hundredth time, he opened WeChat.

Aria's avatar was grayed out.

No reads. No replies.




Texts unanswered. Emails bounced.




Then suddenly he remembered.




He grabbed his bag and ran to her old apartment.




The building looked like a yellowed newspaper.




He rang the bell.

No answer.




A white paper was taped to the door:




"Unit under management cleaning. Do not enter."




Bilingual. Neat.




She came. She lived.

She erased herself.




The lock had been changed.

Even her black canvas sneakers were gone.




She was like a playing card pulled from the bottom of a deck,

No noise, but the entire stack collapsed.




Late Night




Yuji sat on the carpet in the dark.

No ceiling lights.

Only the glow of a single screen.




He scrolled through the comment section of the blog post.




And then he saw it, the most liked comment:




"A crazy person doesn't schedule delayed posts.

Doesn't back up three sets of evidence.

Doesn't factory-reset their phone, quit social media, cancel leases, and vanish."




"She's not crazy.

She just left."




It finally sank in.




She hadn't screamed.

Hadn't broken down.

Hadn't used emotion as a weapon.




She simply launched him, his persona, his labels, his polished little image,

into a shredder disguised as a blog post.




No echo.

No warning.




He suddenly thought of her old notebook—the one she never lost.




He pulled it out and flipped to the back.




On the inside cover, a single pen line:




"I'm not trying to win.

I'm just trying to be remembered."




He stared at it for a long time.

In silence.
