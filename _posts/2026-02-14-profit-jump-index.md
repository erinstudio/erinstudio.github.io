Dead in real life, alive in the market.
Aria, a burned-out Tokyo office worker, dies of a heart attack during a stock market crash.
When she opens her eyes, she finds herself back in 2015… with one mission:

Make 10 million yen in 30 days, or die (again).
No cheats, no future leaks—only real history, real trades, and one woman’s burning desire to win.

Each successful round unlocks stronger tools, deeper knowledge, and tougher timelines.
She’s not just trading stocks.
She’s trading fate.

This is not time travel. This is time leverage.
Profit Jump begins now.
