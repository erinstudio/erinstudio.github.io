While secretly waging war against Greg during office hours, Julian had a little side project after dark. An experiment that applied pure MBA frameworks to his private life.

From CRM logs to PDCA loops, to red-flag risk protocols, he ran his dating life like a product pipeline, complete with emotional ROI scores, retention metrics, and Excel sheets built to auto-grade encounters.

What follows is Julian Watanabe's internal report on **Structured Intimacy and Behavioral Conversion**: A Financial Bro's Research on Personal Relations.

### I. Methodology Framework

#### 1.1 Data Collection and Record Management: CRM Modeling
**Primary tools:** Excel (main), Word, and PowerPoint (for visualization)  
**Core data fields:**
* **Name / Alias:** (for anonymity)
* **Professional background:** (industry, income, education)
* **Contact channel:** (Tinder, Bumble, business events, emergencies)
* **Frequency of interaction & latest status**
* **Trigger keywords:** (interests, taboos, emotional red zones)
* **Risk level marking:** 🔴 Red / 🟡 Yellow / 🟢 Green

**Lifecycle stages:**
1.  **Lead:** Contact information obtained, no direct interaction yet.
2.  **Engaged:** Initial chat or first meeting completed.
3.  **Converted:** Physical interaction achieved.
4.  **Retained:** Repeated interaction, established "regular" contact.
5.  **Lost:** Disconnected, terminated, or conflict-based exit.
6.  **Reactivated:** Reconnected after a pause, moved to reassessment.

#### 1.2 Key Performance Metric
Measured not by the number of people, but by **total successful encounters** (including both first-time and repeated).

#### 1.3 Operational Optimization: PDCA Cycle System
* **Plan (P):** Set weekly goals including energy allocation (new vs returning), resource budget (time, money), and pre-arranged settings (location, topics, avoidance list).
* **Do (D):** Execute meetings and interactions, record timestamps, situational control, real-time reactions, and success rates.
* **Check (C):** Complete a next-day review card with emotional feedback, ROI assessment (emotional return per investment of time and money), and retention potential score.
* **Act (A):** Archive results as either "Follow-up Required" or "On Hold," establish regular review cycles, delete high-risk entries, or set a 3‑month cooling reminder.

#### 1.4 Product Design and Persona Testing: Spiral Model
**Initial Persona Versions:**
* **Version A:** Analyst at UBS, Asia Strategy Division. Loves jazz, doesn't smoke.
* **Version B:** UK returnee, freelancer, cooks well. *(Later proven most effective)*.
* **Version C:** Minimalist, enjoys night running, regular at libraries.

**Each iteration included:**
* A/B testing of photos and bios.
* Cross-platform comparison: Tinder vs. Bumble vs. CMB.
* **Data points:** match rate, response rate, first-meet success rate.

#### 1.5 Risk Management: "Risk Flag" Labeling System
* 🔴 **Red Flag:** High-risk overlaps (competitor analysts, HR contacts). **Action:** Immediate freeze + 3-month lockout.
* 🟡 **Yellow Flag:** Ambiguous. Emotionally volatile, vague expectations. **Action:** Limit interaction, space out meetups.
* 🟢 **Green Flag:** Worth retaining. Stable jobs, mature communication. **Action:** Maintenance group, low-friction follow-ups.

### II. Experimental Log: Selected Case Records

| Case ID | Date | Channel | Persona | Outcome | Risk Rating |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **SRRPO–0324** | Mar 24 | Tinder | **Ver. A** | First meeting led to physical engagement. | 🟢 Green |
| **SRRPO–0409** | Apr 09 | Event | **Ver. B** | Confirmed follow-up within a week. | 🟡 Yellow |
| **SRRPO–0522** | May 22 | Bumble | **Ver. C** | No conversion (First and only meeting). | 🔴 Red |
| **SRRPO–0726** | Jul 26 | CMB | **Ver. B** | Immediate repeat; "Regular client zone". | 🟢 Green |

**Case Notes:**
* **SRRPO–0522:** Suspected competitor HR. Account deleted same night. Archived logs.
* **SRRPO–0726:** High interaction frequency, low-maintenance long-term client. Note: "Prefers blue shirts."

### III. Project Results and Data Review (7-Month Audit)

* **Total individuals engaged:** 68
* **Effective conversions:** 8
* **Returning clients:** 3
* **Repeat rate:** 37.5%
* **Share of interactions from repeat clients:** **71.4%**
* **Red flag identification success rate:** 89% (3 potential social incidents avoided)
* **Optimal Persona:** Version B (Freelancer/Mixed Heritage)
* **Subjective satisfaction score:** 8.3 / 10

### V. Conclusion: Implications of SRRM

Though originally framed as an "independent research" initiative, this project functioned as an extension of **structural arbitrage** into private social domains.

Through persona testing, risk-tagging, and behavioral modeling, the project achieved a replicable process, predictable interaction flow, and manageable risk in informal relationships. Findings suggest that **relationship density outperforms relationship breadth** in value generation.

> **Status:** Methodology transferable to future operations in informal network capital management.
