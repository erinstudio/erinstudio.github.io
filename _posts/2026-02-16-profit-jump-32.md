February 2026
Wanaka, New Zealand

The snow on the Southern Alps hasn't melted yet. Outside my window, the lake is a deep, motionless blue—like a massive, frozen monitor display. In this silence, I occasionally find myself drifting back to that leaky 1K apartment in Shibuya ten years ago.

 
I get a lot of emails asking the same things: "Does Aria really exist?" or "Can you settle the debate and leak the address that turned $133 into a 350,000x gain?"


To the thousands of readers who have spent their nights scouring on-chain records for a "Financial Jesus," I owe you an apology. There was no Aria. The miraculous girl on the streets of Shinjuku, eating expired rice balls while laundering money for the mob and clutching a script from the future—she never existed.


The truth is much colder. In 2015, after being tossed aside like a used rag by that godforsaken investment bank in London, I was losing my mind. Sitting in that economy seat on the way back to Tokyo, my brain wasn't running a revenge plot. It was running two completely contradictory lines of logic.


The first was "Julian." He was the LSE honor student, the suit-and-tie cog, the idiot trying to cling to his middle-class dignity while obsessing over the interest on a 13-million-yen mortgage in the suburbs.


The second logic... I called her "Aria."


She was a "God-mode" algorithm I coded during my mental breakdown. She didn't need dignity. She didn't follow rules. She didn't even need to be human. She was the personification of every decision I was too afraid to make. Whenever I stood at a Shinjuku crossing, watching the credit of fiat currency wither like dead leaves, I would boot up "Aria Mode" in my head.


I would ask myself: "If I were the deity who had died once and seen the future, would I go all-in on this trade?"


Every "Profit Jump" in this book was actually clawed out of the market, dollar by dollar, during those years in the wilderness—all by simulating the "Aria Logic." There was no time travel. There was only utter despair in the fiat system and a terminal faith in the logic of computation.


As for those 410 BTC? They're real. But they weren't a gift from a goddess. They were the final grade on a decade-long exam I took in total isolation—my "Sovereign Individual" manifesto.

Writing fiction used to be a vain, middle-class hobby of mine, like playing golf or collecting vinyl. But by the final chapter, I realized Aria had grown into my very marrow.

Now, sitting here under the South Island sun, I no longer need to write about her.


Because when a man finally finds the courage to look at the ruins of a total liquidation and whisper to himself, "No Stop Loss," he doesn't need a god anymore.


He becomes one.


Goodbye, Aria.


Hello, Julian.
